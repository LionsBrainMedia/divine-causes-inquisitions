A judgment triggers in response to the claimant either taking an action or being targeted by an action. Judgments come in two types: condemnations and plaudits. You choose one of these types of judgment when you select a claimant as part of your Judge action. You usually apply a condemnation to enemies and a plaudit to allies. You gain 2 judgments (usually 1 condemnation and 1 plaudit) from your inquisition, and you can gain additional judgments by selecting them as inquisitor feats.

A sentence cantrip affects a single claimant, ends the effects of your Judge for that claimant, and makes them immune to your Judge for 1 hour.

You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you&rsquo;re an inquisitor, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a material component pouch.</p>\n<p class=\"PF2BodyIndent\">Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell and five cantrips. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"PF2BodyIndent\">As you increase in level as an inquisitor, your deity grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast are shown in Table 1: Inquisitor Spells per Day. Because of the specific nature of your inquisition, you begin to lose lower-level spell slots once you reach 5th level. The maximum number of spell slots you get from the inquisitor class is four, starting when you reach 4th level.</p>\n<p class=\"PF2BodyIndent\">Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.</p>\n<h1 class=\"PF2Heading3\">Heightening Spells</h1>\n<p class=\"PF2Body\">When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell&rsquo;s level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h1 class=\"PF2Heading3\">Cantrips</h1>\n<p class=\"PF2Body\">A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up&mdash;this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as an inquisitor.
