Playtest notes:
 * 11 condemnations and 8 plaudits. I'd like to think these should be equitable but I also feel like condemnation will probably get more mileage. 
 * Deity and INquisition class feature needs a different selection menu.
 * Hylar Nix was VERY easy to build and I feel like he's already unique.
 * Bulwark very situational based on party, since inquisitor doesn't start with much healing capacity.

 * The change to temporary HP for plaudit was stellar. I brought Meresiel back up from dying using 2-action heal, judge, and then the temp HP kicked in.
 * I didn't get to do much with my smite judgment because the monsters came after me. Might change that to "you or an ally"
 * I did go down after 1 hit and 1 crit. But this is level 1, so...
 * It was some interesting strategy deciding when to swap Judge claimant. I think the feats to get extra claimants are going to be essential. Probably just hardwire them.
